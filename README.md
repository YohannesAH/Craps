"This is crap game famous in all casinos and alleys around the world with simple smart rules"
Shooter: The game begins with a player, known as the "shooter," rolling two dice.

Come Out Roll: If it's the shooter's first roll of the game, it's called the "come out roll." Depending on the come out roll, there are several possibilities:

If the come out roll is a 7 or 11, it's called a "natural," and the shooter wins.
If the come out roll is a 2, 3, or 12, it's called "craps," and the shooter loses (also known as "sevening out").
If the come out roll is any other number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), that number becomes the "point."
Establishing the Point: Once a point is established, the shooter continues to roll the dice until either:

They roll the point number again, in which case they win.
They roll a 7, in which case they lose (this is called "sevening out").
Pass Line Bet: Players can bet on the outcome of the shooter's rolls. The most common bet is the "pass line" bet, where players win if the shooter rolls a natural or the point before rolling a 7.

Don't Pass Bet: Alternatively, players can bet against the shooter by placing a "don't pass" bet. In this case, they win if the shooter rolls craps (2, 3, or 12) on the come out roll, or if they seven out after establishing a point.

Other Betting Options: There are many other betting options in craps, including betting on specific numbers or combinations of numbers, as well as proposition bets on single rolls. These bets have different payouts and odds.

Rolls Continue: After resolving the outcome of a roll, the dice are passed to the next player in clockwise order, who becomes the new shooter.
